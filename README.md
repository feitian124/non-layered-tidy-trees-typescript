# tree-layout

tree-layout implemented an algorithm to draw beautify trees.(only generate x, y coordinate for you)

This a typescript port from the project <https://github.com/stetrevor/non-layered-tidy-tree-layout> , which is written in javascript,
and enhanced by the ideas from <http://github.com/llimllib/pymag-trees>
